## 📂 Project Structure

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or above)
- npm

### Steps

```bash
npm install
npm start

📌 This is **documentation only**, not something that auto-runs.

---

## ❗ Common confusion (important)

- ❌ Writing `npm start` in README **does NOT execute it**
- ✅ It only **shows instructions** for the reviewer

The interviewer will:
1. Clone your repo
2. Read README
3. Run these commands themselves

---

## 🔍 What if I already ran `npm start` before?

Totally fine 👍  
You **don’t need to do anything again**.

Just:
```bash
git add README.md
git commit -m "Update README with run instructions"
git push
